Are you in Wuhan? Tell us about living with the coronavirus outbreak
As China unveils measures to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus and airports around the world carry out screenings of arriving passengers, we’d like to hear from people in Wuhan, where the outbreak of the Sars-like virus is thought to have originated and other affected cities. Authorities have ordered Wuhan residents not to leave the city and have shut down transportation links. All citizens must wear face masks while in public places. Nearby cities have also cut off transportation links. Tell us what life is like in Wuhan at the moment and any other cities that are experiencing a lockdown.
