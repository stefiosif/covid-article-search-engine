Officials tracked each foreign infection back to someone who was either from or had recently visited Wuhan. The virus - labelled 2019-nCoV - is believed to have originated in a seafood and wildlife market in the city, which has a population of 11 million, where it crossed the species barrier from animal to human. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not yet recommended trade or travel restrictions but is guiding countries preparing for potential outbreaks.  The 2019-nCoV is one part of a species of viruses which cause different strains and symptoms. Several coronavirus strains present with mild symptoms, and feel much like the flu or common cold. Others strains are more severe, including the deadly SARS, which killed 700 people when it broke out in China during 2002-2003.
