Investor behavior is eerily similar to that of January 2018 — a selloff is brewing, warns strategist
Investors are facing a new worry on their return from a long weekend: the potential that China’s coronavirus will spread massively during a big upcoming national holiday. “The worry is this is another SARS, an outbreak that saw thousands infected and led to hundreds of deaths. It also led to billions of dollars of losses and hit Chinese GDP growth by up to 1 percentage point,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at trading platform Markets.com. A repeat of that would mean the International Monetary Fund’s latest and less-optimistic forecasts not standing up and a sharp contraction for many leading indicators of the global economy, he told clients. While it’s probably too soon to panic, a pandemic scare may be an excuse for some investors to cash in on a bullish start to the year — the S&P 500 managed its sixth record close of 2020 on Friday. That leads us to our call of the day , from Saxo Bank’s head of equity strategy Peter Garnry, who is flashing a short-term warning about a stock selloff, especially for technology names, which have led 2019’s gains. “The acceleration that we have seen seems quite similar to what we saw in January 2018,” Garnry told MarketWatch in an interview. During that month, the S&P climbed 5.6%, then dropped 3.9% and 2.7% in February and March 2018 respectively. Mimicking similar moves in the run-up to that selloff, he notes “epic short squeeze” in shares of electric-car maker Tesla TSLA, +2.44% , for example. That refers to a stock spiking because bearish investors, who sold borrowed shares as they bet on a fall, have to buy them back at higher prices. And then he sees the FANG (Facebook FB, -0.26% , Amazon AMZN, -0.39% , Netflix NFLX, -0.10% and Alphabet-parent Google GOOGL, +0.34% ) + Index NYFANG, -1.26% “accelerating at an unprecedented pace showing clear signs of frothy behavior.” Note Netflix reports after the close. As well as this, investors aren’t buying much downside protection for stocks, Garnry said. But on the bright side, he said when this selloff gets out of the way, equities will probably keep marching higher.
