CDC confirms one case of coronavirus in the U.S.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Tuesday that a single case of the coronavirus that has sickened more than 300 people, mostly in China, has been diagnosed in the U.S. The patient is a U.S. resident who arrived back in the country after a visit to Wuhan, China, the main source of the current outbreak, before screening had been introduced. The patient did not know anyone who was ill and did not visit a seafood market that is believed to have been a source of the illness. More than six people have died of the virus. Fears of a pandemic similar to SARS in 2003, sent stocks lower Tuesday, hurting airlines, casino operators with operations in Macau, luxury goods giants while boosting the stocks of vaccine makers.
