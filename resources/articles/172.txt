Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Rise
U.S. stocks rose despite concerns about the coronavirus in China. Illustration by Michael George Haddad Bouncing. The three major U.S. stock market indexes rose modestly, bouncing back despite fears about the newly identified virus spreading in China . The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%. Midday Movers Capital One Financial (ticker: COF) gained 4.7% after the credit-card issuer reported strong earnings buoyed by solid consumer credit performance. Ball (BLL) was up 3.1% as the metal packager bounced back from Tuesday’s slump in packaging companies caused by a report that containerboard prices have fallen this month. Texas Instruments (TXN) rose 3.1%. The company—the first chip maker to report fourth-quarter earnings—saw its shares gain ahead of its after-the-close release. Northern Trust (NTRS) fell 5.9% after it missed Wall Street’s earnings expectations, but exceeded analysts’ revenue consensus. Zions Bancorp (ZION) lost 4.5% after the stock was downgraded to neutral from buy by Bank of America. Write to Ben Walsh at ben.walsh@barrons.com
