UPDATE: Singapore and Vietnam report cases of coronavirus that has quarantined Wuhan, China
Singapore has confirmed a first case of the coronavirus that has led to the quarantine of the Chinese city of Wuhan, Channel News Asia reported on Thursday. That news was followed by confirmation from officials in Vietnam, that two Chinese nationals are being treated in hospital, as AFP reported. The outbreak has sickened more than 500 people in China and 17 patients have died from the illness, according to official reports. Wuhan, the site of the first reports of the illness believed to have started at a seafood market, is on lockdown to prevent it from spreading further. The illness can cause pneumonia and other respiratory issues and has been compared to SARS and MERS, two other coronaviruses. The World Health Organization is scheduled to meet again on Thursday after ending a meeting Wednesday without deciding whether to declare the illness a global health emergency.
